# Background

These notes on repositories are a basic introduction and are intended to let us share a basis of terminology and understanding. Use these notes as a starting point and read widely!&#x20;

You may have done coding before and if you are like most people, there are bits of programmes on your hard drive or cloud share. Not very useful!

In most working environments, we would move our code to a repository or repo. This is primarily a code archive, where we can see current code, as well as the versions that mark its evolution. The versioning aspect of this it's critically important.&#x20;

* I can roll my code back to a point in time before an error was made, perhaps.&#x20;
* I can work collaboratively, and each contributor can see and track what others have done.&#x20;

You will hear the terms version control, revision control and source control. If I mix up the naming, I am referring to the same thing!&#x20;

These notes are delivered as part of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) learning. Realistically, we do not automate without having the repo sorted out first.&#x20;

Think about network configuration files.&#x20;

Suppose you save the configuration of a router or switch in a Git repo.&#x20;

Does this have a useful purpose?&#x20;

Would the ability to review differences from configuration to configuration have a value?&#x20;

As a good practice, you should always have a good, known version of a project or configuration.
