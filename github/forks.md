# Forks

In UNIX, when you fork, you create a copy of a process which is then independent of the original.

In repos, the term fork seems to be unique to GitHub, it isnâ€™t used in older repo technology. Many of my repos are public and have a license attached. Generally, if you credit me as the source of the code, my code can be freely reused. If someone wants to use one of my repos, they can fork it to their own repo.

Consider the diagram below. After my fifth commit, someone copies my repo to their own GitHub account (green). Later, after my thirteenth commit, another user forks my repo to their account (orange).

Everything is copied at a point in time, my changes, comments, etc. Any changes made after that point are not copied. Once a repo is forked, it is an entirely different repo.
